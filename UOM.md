# Unit Of Measure (UOM)
There are 5 UOM codes
 - 01 - Board Feet
 - 02 - Cords
 - 03 - Cubic Feet
 - 04 - Piece Count
 - 05 - Weight

The unit of measure is generally related to the type of product being sold. 

Tim only allows one UOM per sale however some sales may want to use a different UOM for bio or firewood.

We are storing the UOM at the Sample Group level as well as a default UOM at the sale level. With hopes that in the future a new TIM system will be created to allow multiple UOMs per sale.
